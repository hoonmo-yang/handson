Through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, I could see them 
hitting. They were coming toward where the flag was and I went along the 
fence. Luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree. They took the flag 
out, and they were hitting. Then they put the flag back and they went to the 
table, and he hit and the other hit. Then they went on, and I went along the 
fence. Luster came away from the flower tree and we went along the fence 
and they stopped and we stopped and I looked through the fence while 
Luster was hunting in the grass. 
"Here, caddie." He hit. They went away across the pasture. I held to the 
fence and watched them going away. 
"Listen at you, now." Luster said. "Aint you something, thirty three years
old, going on that way. After I done went all the way to town to buy you 
that cake. Hush up that moaning. Aint you going to help me find that 
quarter so I can go to the show tonight." 
They were hitting little, across the pasture. I went back along the fence to 
where the flag was. It flapped on the bright grass and the trees. 
"Come on." Luster said. "We done looked there. They aint no more coming 
right now. Les go down to the branch and find that quarter before them 
niggers finds it." 
It was red, flapping on the pasture. Then there was a bird slanting and 
tilting on it. Luster threw. The flag flapped on the bright grass and the 
trees. I held to the fence. 
"Shut up that moaning." Luster said. "I cant make them come if they aint 
coming, can I. If you dont hush up, mammy aint going to have no birthday 
for you. If you dont hush, you know what I going to do. I going to eat that 
cake all up. Eat them candles, too. Eat all them thirty three candles. Come 
on, les go down to the branch. I got to find my quarter. Maybe we can find 
one of they balls. Here. Here they is. Way over yonder. See." He came to 
the fence and pointed his arm. "See them. They aint coming back here no 
more. Come on. 
We went along the fence and came to the garden fence, where our shadows 
were. My shadow was higher than Luster's on the fence. We came to the 
hroken place and went through it. 
"Wait a minute." Luster said. "You snagged on that nail again. Cant you 
never crawl through here without snagging on that nail." 
Caddy uncaught me and we crawled through. Uncle Maury said to not let 
anybody see us, so we better stoop over, Caddy said. Stoop over, Benjy. 
Like this, see. We stooped over and crossed the garden, where the flowers 
rasped and rattled against us. The ground was hard. We climbed the 
fence, where the pigs were grunting and snuffing. I expect they're sorry 
because one of them got killed today, Caddy said. The ground was hard, 
churned and knotted. Keep your hands in your pockets, Caddy said. Or 
they'll get froze. You dont want your hands froze on Christmas, do you. 
"It's too cold out there." Versh said. "You dont want to go outdoors." 
"What is it now." Mother said. 
"He want to go out doors." Versh said. 
"Let him go." Uncle Maury said. 
"It's too cold." Mother said. "He'd better stay in. Benjamin. Stop that, 
now." 
"It wont hurt him." Uncle Maury said. 
"You, Benjamin." Mother said. "If vou dont be good, you'll have to go to the 
kitchen." 
"Mammy say keep him out the kitchen today." Versh said. "She say she got 
all that cooking to get done." 
"Let him go, Caroline." Uncle Maury said. "You'll worry yourself sick over 
him." 
"I know it." Mother said. "It's a judgment on me. I sometimes wonder." 
"I know, I know." Uncle Maury said. "You must keep your strength up. I'll 
make you a toddy." 
"It just upsets me that much more." Mother said. "Dont you know it does." 
"You'll feel better. " Uncle Maury said. "Wrap him up good, boy, and take 
him out for a while." 
Uncle Maury went away. Versh went away. 
"Please hush." Mother said. "We're trying to get you out as fast as we can. I 
dont want you to get sick." 
Versh put my overshoes and overcoat on and we took my cap and went out. 
Uncle Maury was putting the bottle away in the sideboard in the 
diningroom. 
"Keep him out about half an hour, boy." Uncle Maury said. "Keep him in 
the yard, now." 
"Yes, sir." Versh said. "We dont never let him get off the place." 
We went out doors. The sun was cold and bright. 
"Where you heading for." Versh said. "You dont think you going to town, 
does you." We went through the rattling leaves. The gate was cold. "You 
better keep them hands in your pockets." Versh said. "You get them froze 
onto that gate, then what you do. Whyn't you wait for them in the house."
He put my hands into my pockets. I could hear him rattling in the leaves. I 
could smell the cold. The gate was cold. 
"Here some hickeynuts. Whooey. Git up that tree. Look here at this squirl, 
Benjy." I couldn't feel the gate at all, but I could smell the bright cold. "You 
better put them hands back in your pockets." 
Caddy was walking. Then she was running, her booksatchel swinging and 
jouncing behind her. 
"Hello, Benjy." Caddy said. She opened the gate and came in and stooped 
down. Caddy smelled like leaves. "Did you come to meet me." she said. 
"Did you come to meet Caddy. What did you let him get his hands so cold 
for, Versh." "I told him to keep them in his pockets." Versh said. "Holding 
on to that ahun gate." 
"Did you come to meet Caddy." she said, rubbing my hands. "What is it. 
What are you trying to tell Caddy." Caddy smelled like trees and like when 
she says we were asleep. 
What are you moaning about, Luster said. You can watch them again 
when we get to the branch. Here. Here's you a jimson weed. He gave me 
the flower. We went through the fence, into the lot. 
"What is it." Caddy said "What are you trying to tell Caddy. Did they send 
him out, Versh." 
"Couldn't keep him in." Versh said. "He kept on until they let him go and 
he come right straight down here, looking through the gate." 
"What is it." Caddy said. "Did you think it would be Christmas when I came 
home from school. Is that what you thought. Christmas is the day after 
tomorrow. Santy Claus, Benjy. Santy Claus. Come on, let's run to the house 
and get warm." She took my hand and we ran through the bright rustling 
leaves. We ran up the steps and out of the bright cold, into the dark cold. 
Uncle Maury was putting the bottle back in the sideboard. He called Caddy. 
Caddy said, 
"Take him in to the fire, Versh. Go with Versh." she said. "I'll come in a 
minute." 
We went to the fire. Mother said, 
"Is he cold, Versh." 
"Nome." Versh said. 
"Take his overcoat and overshoes off." Mother said. "How many times do I 
have to tell you not to bring him into the house with his overshoes on. 
"Yessum." Versh said. "Hold still, now." He took my overshoes off and 
unbuttoned my coat. Caddy said, 
"Wait, Versh. Cant he go out again, Mother. I want him to go with me. 
"You'd better leave him here." Uncle Maury said. "He's been out enough 
today." 
"I think you'd both better stay in." Mother said. "It's getting colder, Dilsey 
says." 
"Oh, Mother." Caddy said. 
"Nonsense." Uncle Maury said. "She's been in school all day. She needs the 
fresh air. Run along, Candace." 
"Let him go, Mother." Caddy said. "Please. You know he'll cry." 
"Then why did you mention it before him." Mother said. "Why did you 
come in here. To give him some excuse to worry me again. You've been out 
enough today. I think you'd better sit down here and play with him." 
"Let them go, Caroline." Uncle Maury said. "A little cold wont hurt them. 
Remember, you've got to keep your strength up. 
"I know." Mother said. "Nobody knows how I dread Christmas. Nobody
knows. I am not one of those women who can stand things. I wish for 
Jason's and the children's sakes I was stronger." 
"You must do the best you can and not let them worry you. " Uncle Maury 
said. "Run along. you two. But dont stay out long, now. Your mother will 
worry." 
"Yes, sir." Caddy said. "Come on, Benjy. We're going out doors again." She 
buttoned my coat and we went toward the door. 
"Are you going to take that baby out without his overshoes." Mother said. 
"Do you want to make him sick, with the house full of company." 
"I forgot." Caddy said. "I thought he had them on. We went back. "You 
must think." Mother said. Hold still now Versh said. He put my overshoes 
on. "Someday I'll be gone, and you'll have to think for him." Now stomp
Versh said. "Come here and kiss Mother, Benjamin." 
Caddy took me to Mother's chair and Mother took my face in her hands 
and then she held me against her. 
"My poor baby." she said. She let me go. "You and Versh take good care of
him, honey." 
"Yessum." Caddy said. We went out. Caddy said, 
"You needn't go, Versh. I'll keep him for a while." 
"All right." Versh said. "I aint going out in that cold for no fun." He went on 
and we stopped in the hall and Caddy knelt and put her arms around me 
and her cold bright face against mine. She smelled like trees. 
"You're not a poor baby. Are you. Are you. You've got your Caddy. Haven't 
you got your Caddy." 
Cant you shut up that moaning and slobbering, Luster said. Aint you 
shamed of yourself, making all this racket. We passed the carriage house, 
where the carriage was. It had a new wheel. 
"Git in, now, and set still until your maw come." Dilsey said. She shoved
me into the carriage. T.P. held the reins. "Clare I dont see how come Jason 
wont get a new surrey." Dilsey said. "This thing going to fall to pieces under 
you all some day. Look at them wheels." 
Mother came out, pulling her veil down. She had some flowers. 
"Where's Roskus." she said. 
"Roskus cant lift his arms, today." Dilsey said. "T.P. can drive all right." 
"I'm afraid to." Mother said. "It seems to me you all could furnish me with 
a driver for the carriage once a week. It's little enough I ask, Lord knows." 
"You know just as well as me that Roskus got the rheumatism too bad to do 
more than he have to, Miss Cahline." Dilsey said. "You come on and get in, 
now. T.P. can drive you just as good as Roskus." 
"I'm afraid to." Mother said. "With the baby." Dilsey went up the steps. 
"You calling that thing a baby." she said. She took Mother's arm. "A man 
big as T.P. Come on, now, if you going." 
"I'm afraid to." Mother said. They came down the steps and Dilsey helped 
Mother in. "Perhaps it'll be the best thing, for all of us." Mother said. 
"Aint you shamed, talking that way." Dilsey said. "Dont you know it'll take 
more than a eighteen year old nigger to make Queenie run away. She older 
than him and Benjy put together. And dont you start no projecking with 
Queenie, you hear me. T.P. If you dont drive to suit Miss Cahline, I going to 
put Roskus on you. He aint too tied up to do that." 
"Yessum." T.P. said. 
"I just know something will happen." Mother said. "Stop, Benjamin. 
"Give him a flower to hold." Dilsey said. "That what he wanting." She 
reached her hand in. 
"No, no." Mother said. "You'll have them all scattered." 
"You hold them." Dilsey said. "I'll get him one out." She gave me a flower
and her hand went away. 
"Go on now, fore Quentin see you and have to go too." Dilsey said. 
"Where is she." Mother said. 
"She down to the house playing with Luster." Dilsey said. "Go on, T.P.
Drive that surrey like Roskus told you, now. 
"Yessum." T.P. said. "Hum up, Queenie." 
"Quentin." Mother said. "Dont let " 
"Course I is." Dilsey said. 
The carriage jolted and crunched on the drive. "I'm afraid to go and leave 
Quentin." Mother said. "I'd better not go. T.P." We went through the gate,
where it didn't jolt anymore. T.P. hit Queenie with the whip. 
"You, T.P." Mother said. 
"Got to get her going." T.P. said. "Keep her wake up till we get back to the 
barn." 
"Turn around." Mother said. "I'm afraid to go and leave Quentin." 
"Cant turn here." T.P. said. Then it was broader. 
"Cant you turn here." Mother said. 
"All right." T.P. said. We began to turn. 
"You, T.P." Mother said, clutching me. 
"I got to turn around some how." T.P. said. "Whoa, Queenie." We stopped. 
"You'll turn us over." Mother said. 
"What you want to do, then." T.P. said. 
"I'm afraid for you to try to turn around." Mother said. 
"Get up, Queenie." T.P. said. We went on. 
"I just know Dilsey will let something happen to Quentin while I'm gone." 
Mother said. "We must hurry back." 
"Hum up,' there." T.P. said. He hit Queenie with the whip. 
"You, T.P." Mother said, clutching me. I could hear Qucenie's feet and the 
bright shapes went smooth and steady on both sides, the shadows of them 
flowing across Queenie's back. They went on like the bright tops of wheels. 
Then those on one side stopped at the tall white post where the soldier was. 
But on the other side they went on smooth and steady, but a little slower. 
"What do you want." Jason said. He had his hands in his pockets and a 
pencil behind his ear. 
"We're going to the cemetery." Mother said. 
"All right." Jason said. "I dont aim to stop you, do I. Was that all you 
wanted with me, just to tell me that." 
"I know you wont come." Mother said. "I'd feel safer if you would." 
"Safe from what." Jason said. "Father and Quentin cant hurt you." 
Mother put her handkerchief under her veil. "Stop it, Mother." Jason said. 
"Do you want to get that damn looney to bawling in the middle of the 
square. Drive on, T.P." 
"Hum up, Queenie." T.P. said. 
"It's a judgment on me." Mother said. "But I'll be gone too, soon. 
"Here." Jason said. 
"Whoa." T.P. said. Jason said, 
"Uncle Maury's drawing on you for fifty. What do you want to do about it." 
"Why ask me." Mother said. "I dont have any say so. I try not to worry you 
and Dilsey. I'll be gone soon, and then you " 
"Go on, T.P." Jason said. 
"Hum up, Queenie." T.P. said. The shapes flowed on. The ones on thc other 
side began again, bright and fast and smooth, like when Caddy says we are 
going to sleep. 
Cry baby, Luster said. Aint you shamed. We went through the barn. The 
stalls were all open. You aint got no spotted pony to ride now, Luster said. 
The floor was dry and dusty. The roof was falling. The slanting holes 
were full of spinning yellow. What do you want to go that way, for. You 
want to get your head knocked off with one of them balls. 
“Keep your hands in your pockets." Caddy said. "Or they'll be froze. You 
dont want your hands froze on Christmas, do you." 
We went around the barn. The big cow and the little one were standing in 
the door, and we could hear Prince and Queenie and Fancy stomping 
inside the barn. "If it wasn't so cold, we'd ride Fancy." Caddy said. "But it's 
too cold to hold on today." Then we could seethe branch, where the smoke 
was blowing. "That's where they are killing the pig." Caddy said. "We can 
come back by there and see them." We went down the hill. 
"You want to carry the letter." Caddy said. "You can carry it." She took the 
letter out of her pocket and put it in mine. "It's a Christmas present." 
Caddy said. "Uncle Maury is going to surprise Mrs Patterson with it. We 
got to give it to her without letting anybody see it. Keep your hands in your 
pockets good, now." We came to the branch. 
"It's froze." Caddy said. "Look." She broke the top of the water and held a 
piece of it against my face. "Ice. That means how cold it is." She helped me 
across and we went up the hill. "We cant even tell Mother and Father. You 
know what I think it is. I think it's a surprise for Mother and Father and Mr 
Patterson both, because Mr Patterson sent you some candy. Do you 
remember when Mr Patterson sent you some candy last summer. 
There was a fence. The vine was dry, and the wind rattled in it. 
"Only I dont see why Uncle Maury didn't send Versh." Caddy said. "Versh 
wont tell." Mrs Patterson was looking out the window. "You wait here." 
Caddy said. "Wait right here, now. I'll be back in a minute. Give me the 
letter." She took the letter out of my pocket. "Keep your hands in your 
pockets." She climbed the fence with the letter in her hand and went 
through the brown, rattling flowers. Mrs Patterson came to the door and 
opened it and stood there. 
Mr Patterson was chopping in the green flowers. He stopped chopping 
and looked at me. Mrs Patterson came across the garden, running. When 
I saw her eyes I began to cry. You idiot, Mrs Patterson said, I told him 
never to send you alone again. Give it to me. Quick. Mr Patterson came 
fast, with the hoc. Mrs Patterson leaned across the fence, reaching her 
hand. She was trying to climb the fence. Give it to me, she said, Give it to 
me. Mr Patterson climbed the fence. He took the letter. Mrs Patterson's 
dress was caught on the fence. I saw her eyes again and I ran down the 
hill. 
"They aint nothing over yonder but houses." Luster said. "We going down 
to the branch." 
They were washing down at the branch. One of them was singing. I could 
smell the clothes flapping, and the smoke blowing across the branch. 
"You stay down here." Luster said. "You aint got no business up yonder. 
Them folks hit you, sho." 
"What he want to do." 
"He dont know what he want to do." Luster said. "He think he want to go 
up yonder where they knocking that hall. You sit down here and play with 
your jimson weed. Look at them chillen playing in the branch, if you got to 
look at something. How come you cant behave yourself like folks." I sat
down on the bank, where they were washing, and the smoke blowing blue. 
"Is you all seen anything of a quarter down here." Luster said."What 
quarter." 
""The one I had here this morning." Luster said. "I lost it somewhere. It fell 
through this here hole in my pocket. If I dont find it I cant go to the show 
tonight." 
"Where'd you get a quarter, boy. Find it in white folks' pocket while they
aint looking." 
"Got it at the getting place." Luster said "Plenty more where that one come 
ftom. Only I got to find that one. Is you all found it yet." 
"I aint studying no quarter. I got my own business to tend to." 
"Come on here." Luster said. "Help me look for it." 
"He wouldn't know a quarter if he was to see it, would he.""He can help 
look just the same." Luster said. "You all going to the show tonight." 
"Dont talk to me about no show. Time I get done over this here tub I be too 
tired to lift my hand to do nothing." 
"I bet you be there." Luster said. "I bet you was there last night. I bet you
all be right there when that tent open."Be enough niggers there without 
me. Was last night." 
"Nigger's money good as white folks, I reckon." 
"White folks gives nigger money because know first white man comes 
along with a band going to get it all back, so nigger can go to work for some 
more." 
"Aint nobody going make you go to that show." 
"Aint yet. Aint thought of it, I reckon." 
"What you got against white folks." 
"Aint got nothing against them. I goes my way and lets white folks go 
theirs. I aint studying that show." 
"Got a man in it can play a tune on a saw. Play it like a banjo." 
"You go last night." Luster said. "I going tonight If I can find where I lost 
that quarter." 
"You going take him with you, I reckon." 
"Me." Luster said. "You reckon I be found anywhere with him, time he start 
bellering." 
"What does you do when he start bellering." 
"I whips him." Luster said. He sat down and rolled up his overalls. They
played in the branch. 
"You all found any balls yet." Luster said. 
"Aint you talking biggity. I bet you better not let your grandmammy hear 
you talking like that." 
Luster got into the branch, where they were playing. He hunted in the 
water, along the bank. 
"I had it when we was down here this morning." Luster said. 
"Where bouts you lose it." 
"Right out this here hole in my pocket." Luster said. They hunted in the 
branch. Then they all stood up quick and stopped, then they splashed and 
fought in the branch. Luster got it and they squatted in the water, looking 
up the hill through the bushes. 
"Where is they." Luster said.
